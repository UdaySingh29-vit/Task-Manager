# Task-Manager
VITyarthi CSA Flipped course project ,AI&amp;ML
# Introduction
To design a simple console based python program that help end user for managing tasks on daily basis<br>
**name:** Uday Pratap Singh <br>
**reg no.:** 25BAI11360

# Overview of the project
The Task Manager is a simple, command-line application designed to help users manage their To-Do list. It allows users to add new tasks, mark existing tasks as complete, and view both their pending and completed tasks. All data is stored in memory (l for to-do and d for done) for the duration of the program's execution.

# Features
The Task Manager offers the following core functionalities:<br>
* **Add Task:** Allows the user to specify the number of tasks they want to add and then input each task, which is added to the To-Do list.<br>
* **Mark Task as Done:** Allows the user to input the name of a task they have completed. The program removes this task from the To-Do list and moves it to the Done list.<br>
* **Show Lists: **Displays the current list of To-Do tasks and the list of Done tasks. If the Done list is empty, a motivational message is displayed.<br>
* **Exit Program:** Terminates the application. Before exiting, it reminds the user of any remaining tasks and displays a final snapshot of both lists.<br>

# Technologies/Tools Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Code Editor:** VS Code

# Steps to Install & Run

# Instruction for testing
* Open your messaging application (e.g., Messages, WhatsApp, Signal).
* Start a New Conversation by tapping the "New Message" or "Compose" icon (often a pencil and paper).
* Select a Contact by typing their name or phone number into the "To" field, or by selecting them from your contacts list.
* Tap in the text entry box at the bottom of the screen to bring up the keyboard.
* Type Your Message.
  - Keep it concise and to the point.
  - Use proper punctuation and grammar to ensure clarity.
  - Consider using emojis (sparingly) to convey tone, but avoid excessive use.
* Review your message for clarity and typos before sending.
* Send the Message by tapping the "Send" button (usually an arrow icon).
* Reply to an incoming text by opening the conversation and typing your response in the text entry box.
